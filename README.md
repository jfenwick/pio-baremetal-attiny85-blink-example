PlatformIO Bare Metal ATtiny85 Blink Example

Useful for learning how to program AVR chips with no bootloader using PlatformIO.

![PCB](https://jfenwick.github.io/images/attiny85-blink-pcb.jpg)<br>
This PCB should give an idea of how to hookup the programmer to the IC.

I also made a [PCB](https://github.com/jfenwick/attiny85-blink-pcb) that can be programmed.

Based on the code at http://karooza.net/going-bare-metal-on-the-attiny85 but using PlatformIO for the toolchain.
